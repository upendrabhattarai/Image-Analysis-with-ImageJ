     To draw the outline of cells or for marking the ROI there are several tools available in the FIJI, numbers 1-5 in the image below. 
     If you hover your mouse over them, You can see what those tools can do. To mark irregular shapes like our cells, I prefer the polygon selection (Number 3).

     After marking each cells you have to add that selection in the ROI manager, otherwise you will loose the selection.
