# Lets start with some basic functions.

## To open images:

With the ImageJ built-in functions:
`File` -> `Open`
or
`File` -> `Import`
Or you can simply drag and drop the image file in the FIJI window.

The ImageJ built-in plugin can open most types of scientific image format. In case it doesn't you can use Bio-Formats plugins

`Plugins` -> `Bio-Formats` -> `Bio-Formats Importer`

A window popsup when you open an image file. Most of the time, use `Hyperstack` as the open method. 
You can also also check Autoscale box on the left bottom if not sometimes images might not be visible before you adjust the brightness and contrast.
