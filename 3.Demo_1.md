# Image format Tiff vs Jpeg
Run the `Tiff_or_Jpeg Macro.ijm` file in FIJI (Drag and drop and hit Run).
![Tiff_or_Jpeg](Files/Tiff_or_jpeg.png)

Save the result image as Tiff, Jpeg, find three differences.
Hint:
upload both, the tiff and the jpeg images in ImageJ, zoom it a bit and scroll over the four dots at the center, you can see the x, and y coordinates where your pointer is in the image and also the intensity value in ImageJ window.

Save the image as `Text image`, see the intensity distributions.

Saving the image in Jpeg format will distort the original intensity distribution. So its always best to save the images in Tiff format.
